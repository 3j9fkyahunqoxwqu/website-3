I conduct research on the socio-technical aspects of cybersecurity. My current
work includes analysis of gains and losses due to undesirable activity on the
Internet, investigating human factors in effective Internet security
mechanisms, and building new technological primitives with the goal of
increasing the practical security and privacy of Internet users.

I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively
conversation regarding security research - please reach out via email or
twitter if you'd like to chat!
