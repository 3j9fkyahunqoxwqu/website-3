My current work includes analysis of Internet attackers' financial successes,
investigating human factors in effective Internet security mechanisms, and
employing economic analysis tools to cybercrime.

I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively
conversation regarding security research - please email me if you are
interested in any of these!
