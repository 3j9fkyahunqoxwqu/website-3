title: Prospective students
---

As mentioned on my home page, I am *always* interested in new collaborations
and motivated students. However, I only consider prospective students under one
of two circumstances:

1. The student has been accepted and arrived at UIC for their PhD in Computer
  Science, has excelled in classes, and has shown an interest and ability to
  perform research in security and/or privacy. In this case, a good prospective
  student should browse my latest papers, find a topic which is interesting to
  them, and ask to set up a meeting to talk about recent research. If at that
  meeting the student doesn't show an understanding of the research, the
  meeting will end.
2. The student is applying to UIC for a PhD in Computer Science, has shown a
  clear ability to contribute to research within or near security and privacy,
  and has recommendations from active researcher(s) in their field.  **I will
  only respond to emails** which show an understanding of what my research area
  is, evidence showing that the student is prepared to specifically conduct
  research with me, and a genuine interest in coming to UIC.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to meet with or respond to any students,
from UIC or otherwise, who do not first meet these requirements. Interestingly
enough, The best applicants perform this task without having read this page.
